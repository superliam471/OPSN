# Optimization Problem Solving Network (OPSN)

## Intro

Optimization problems play a crucial role in scientific research and engineering. This project presents the Optimization Problem Solving Network (OPSN), a new neural network design aimed at solving these challenges effectively.

OPSN formulates optimization problems using a dedicated neural network. We tested its performance on 15 CEC2017 benchmark functions and six real-world engineering problems, comparing the results with four other optimization algorithms.

Our findings show that OPSN outperforms existing methods, achieving faster convergence and greater versatility, making it a strong solution for optimization tasks.
